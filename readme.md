this is basically HORSE the basketball game for iPad. Players take turns drawing things (using the iPad's multi-touch input) and imitating each other. But, since the drawing part is linked with time, it feels like more of a dance, a dance imitation game.

it's still a cool, simple fun idea!

this was also the first time I used HaxePunk and AIR. I believe I still ran into problems of using OpenFL's drawing class to draw primitives to iOS (OpenGL ES)... but I don't quite remember. Anyway, I remember the experience being a million times better than Cocos2D.
